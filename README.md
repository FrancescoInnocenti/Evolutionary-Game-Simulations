# Evolutionary-Game-Simulations

This repository contains all the major MATLAB code for simulations of evolutionary games for a Bachelor Research Dissertation Project. 

The main script implementing the simulations is in the file ''Spatial_Evolutionary_Game'' and due to Mark (2013). The 'combinator' function is necessary to run this script. The file named ''Worlds_of_Varying_Resource_Clustering'' contains code for network modelling of the environment and creation of worlds with varying spatial clustering of resources.
