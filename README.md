# Evolutionary_Game_Simulations

This repository contains all the major MATLAB code for evolutionary game simulations for a Bachelor Research Dissertation. The main script implementing the simulations is **Spatial_Evolutionary_Game** and due to Mark (2013). The **combinator** function is necessary to run this script. The code is divided into 7 main blocks:
1. Simulation parameters
2. Initialisation of strategies
3. Start of game
5. Selection
6. Recombination
7. Mutation
8. Video animations

A simplified schematic of the model is shown below.

The file **Worlds_of_Varying_Resource_Clustering** contains code for network modelling of the environment and creation of worlds with varying spatial clustering of resources.
