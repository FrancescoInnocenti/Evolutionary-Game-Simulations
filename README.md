# Evolutionary-Game-Simulations

This repository contains all the major MATLAB code for simulations of evolutionary games for a Bachelor Research Dissertation Project.

The code in ''Spatial_Evolutionary_Game'' is due to Mark (2013) and constitutes the main script implementing the simulations. The 'combinator' function is necessary to run this script. The file named ''Worlds_of_Varying_Resource_Clustering'' contains code for modelling the environment as a network or graph as well as creation of worlds with varying spatial clustering of resources.
