# Evolutionary Game Simulations

This repository holds code of evolutionary game simulations for a Bachelor 
Research Dissertation. The main script implementing the simulations is 
`Spatial_Evolutionary_Game`. The `combinator` function is necessary to run this 
script. The code does the following:

1. Set simulation parameters
2. Initialise strategies
3. Start generation
4. Start session
5. Start game
6. Apply selection, recombination and mutation
7. Make video animations

Here is a simplified schematic of the evolutionary algorithm.

The file `Worlds_of_Varying_Resource_Clustering` contains code for network 
modelling of the environment and creation of worlds with varying spatial 
clustering of resources.
